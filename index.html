                <p>Welcome to my personal homepage, and thank you for dropping by. My name is Henrik, I am 22 years old, and
                    currently study web development at <abbr title="Norwegian University of Science and Technology">NTNU</abbr> Gjøvik.
                    My hometown is Lillehammer, which is approximately 45 minutes away from my university. It is known for
                    hosting the winter Olympics in 1994.
                    Before I moved into a dorm here in Gjøvik last year, I lived there with my family consisting of my
                    parents and my two younger brothers.
                    I make sure to visit them every weekend, especially as I also have a job at the local Joker store.
                </p>
    
                <p>Whenever I have some time to spare I enjoy relaxing with a good Nintendo game. In particular, <cite>The
                        Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</cite> is one of my favourites. One quote from the game I would
                    like to share is from the
                    opening scene where the main character, Link, hears princess Zelda saying: <q>Link... You are the light.
                        OUR light... that must shine upon Hyrule once again. Now go.</q></p>
